I can't imagine the better moment to start a blog than now.

Now, when I spend a lot of time indoors and suffer from a lack of personal interaction in my life. Twitter is a great platform, but sooner or later you understand that 280 symbols aren’t enough.

I don’t want to make any commitments regarding this blog: articles will be both Personal and Tech, big and small, in English and in Russian. No schedule, no rules, just fun!
