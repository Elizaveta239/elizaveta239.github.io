excerpt: How often do you think about necessary elements which make you happy at work?
---

The most important element of happiness at work for me is an understanding of the impact which my work makes on the world. 

I think a lot about it at conferences, where we have a chance to talk to different PyCharm users. Python is a very popular and widely used language, so our users work in absolutely different areas. 

This year changed a lot in our lives, but PyCharm still has a public issue tracker, where users still can directly talk to the product's creators. Of course, it’s weird to ask the user's stories inside issues, but some of them are happy to share their background even without a request. Such people make me so happy! It isn’t just an impersonal user anymore, it’s a scientist in a laboratory.

Once I had a report from a person, who creates aerodynamic software for a Formula 1 team! They come to their work every day, open PyCharm and use it to help someone to win F1! That’s just amazing, I was so impressed by this fact! I’m working on PyCharm and that means that I indirectly help someone to win Formula 1 too! 😏 Or detect [gravitational waves](https://numpy.org/case-studies/gw-discov/). Or maybe create a new vaccine. Sounds cool, right?

Every routine task at work and every contribution into an open source project can help make someone a bit happier or even become a part of a great historical event. Don’t forget about it on Monday morning 😉
