Hi! My name is Lisa Shashkova. Lisa a short version of a Russian name Elizaveta (Елизавета).

I'm a Technical Lead of the [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).
As a Software Developer I was working on debugger and scientific tools in PyCharm, I was mentoring students, took part in 
the [DataSpell IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/) launching. Currently, I'm leading PyCharm development. 

I graduated from [Physics and Mathematics Lyceum 239](http://www.239.ru/) in 2010 (yep, that's why sometimes I have 239 in 
my nicknames). I obtained Specialist's Degree (equivalent of Master’s degree) in Software Engineering at 
[St Petersburg State University](https://english.spbu.ru/) in 2015. Also, I graduated from 
[Computer Science Center](https://compscicenter.ru/) in 2015.

Since 2022 I'm based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
