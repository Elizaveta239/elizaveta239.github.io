Hi! My name is Lisa Shashkova. It's a short version of a Russian name Elizaveta.

I'm a Software Developer at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/), working on the [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
I've been working on Debugger for several years, and now I'm focused on Scientific Tools in PyCharm.
